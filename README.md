# OIerTemplateLib

This is a template library for OIers. You can find some data structures and algorithms.

Now this library is not perfect(in fact, it includes few things).

But after it comes better, you'll be able to use it just like STL or pb_ds.

The code is not as good as industrial code. So if you are good at writing code, please contact me.
